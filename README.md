# F1 Predictions - AI-ML Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the "F1 Predictions - AI-ML Project". This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting Formula 1 race outcomes based on historical data. The project is structured into two main parts: data cleaning and model prediction.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries. The primary libraries used in this project include pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. You can install them using pip:

`pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib`


## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following files:
- **data_cleaning.py**: This script is responsible for cleaning the input data, preparing it for the modeling process.
- **F1_predictor_models.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that contains the machine learning models used for predicting the outcomes of the F1 races.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/esanchezmex/F1.git`

Navigate into the repository directory:

`cd F1`



### Step 2: Data Cleaning
Run the `data_cleaning.py` script to clean the data. This script reads the raw data, performs necessary cleaning operations, and outputs the cleaned data into a format suitable for modeling.

Run the following command in the terminal, or simply run it in your code editor.

`python data_cleaning.py`



### Step 3: Run the Models
Open the `F1_predictor_models.ipynb` notebook:

Execute the cells in the notebook to run the machine learning models and view the predictions.
